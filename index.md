## Prerequisites

- **Use/Create a [Microsoft Azure subscription]**

  All/Most excercises require a [Microsoft Azure subscription]. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for a **[free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services/)** or **[pay-as-you-go](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2332614&clcid=0x409)** plan.

- **[Visual Studio Code]**

  VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give VS Code a try.

  VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the [System Requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) to check if your computer configuration is supported.

- **[Microsoft Edge] Browser**

  I suggest using MS Edge's features like **[Split screen]** that will help view and work with the lessons linked within the lessons linked.  
  In addition, you should create a **[Profile]** within Edge configured to your [Microsoft Azure subscription] mentioned above. This way you will not have to switch your login when you are working these lessons.
