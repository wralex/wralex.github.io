## Prerequisites:

- [Create a Microsoft Sandbox]()

  All/Most excercises within the Microsoft Certifications will require a Microsoft Subscription to work within.
  This would require a full Entra ID and at least one subscription that you can administer. Many labs will have
  this requirement so it is highly recomended to get your own Microsoft Tenant to work with. 

- [Use Microsoft Edge Browser]()

  There are features within Microsoft's Edge Browser that would help you view and work with the lessons that are linked
  within this web site. Please use that as your base browser. In addition to using MS Edge you should create a profile
  that is configured to your Microsoft Sandbox you should use for your lessons. This way you will not have to switch
  your login profile when you are working these lessons

- [Setup Split Screen feature]()

  This feature will allow you to click links and view the content of those links making it easy to view where you are
  within the progress of these lessons.
