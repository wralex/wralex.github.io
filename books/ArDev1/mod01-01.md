## Developer Studio Overview

<div class="row">
  <div class="col align-self-center" markdown="1">

Remedy Developer Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Remedy AR
System applications. It provides all the application development functions needed to design an
application with a modern, powerful, easy-to-use interface.
Remedy Developer Studio uses the Java-based Eclipse platform to provide a framework for its
functions. Eclipse includes functions to organize the user interface (UI) and to work with UI
components that the Developer Studio provides.

You can log on to a Remedy AR System server from any computer on the network that has
access to the server. To use Remedy Developer Studio, you must be a Remedy AR System server
administrator or sub-administrator.

This tool can be installed on Microsoft Windows only.

A representation of the Developer perspective is displayed on the screen. Developer Studio
allows you to view objects by double-clicking objects in the AR System Navigator. When you
double-click, an Object List will appear. If you double-click an object, the editor area will appear.
There are also tabs at the bottom that provide valuable information.

The **Outline** tab allows you to locate objects on a form. It displays a visual overview of the
object in an editor. When you select an item in the outline, it is also selected in the editor and
vice versa. You can sort the objects by **Name** or **Field ID**.

If you are editing a form, you can select a field and the **Properties** tab will display the properties
for that field. All objects have properties, you will explore the properties for each object in the
modules that follow.

Open the Editor perspective and switch to it when you need a large editor area. This perspective
has the **Properties** tab in the top right corner, the **Outline** in the bottom right corner, and
the **Messages** and **Relationships** tabs and the AR System Navigator in a tab group.
