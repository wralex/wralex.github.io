## Tutorials

1. [Editing with VS Code and Pandoc] - This is a tutorial I've created
   using [Visual Studio Code] & [Pandoc] with an [Azure DevOps] repository that
   converts a [Word] document into [Markdown] and then reversing the process
   to generate it back into other formats, such as a Web, PDF, Word, etc.
