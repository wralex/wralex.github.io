I would like to welcome you to my GitHub Pages site. I will post items of
interest and try to assist visitors to some of my knowledge, even if it's not
üíØ% correct. Not only that, but I can share with you some IT skills and even
attempt to create tutorials that I hope you will find useful. Furthermore, I am
always taking feedback from others and would like to hear from you.

## Tutorials

In my journey of IT I have tried to create helpful tutorials, share labs, or
even have discussions. Below is a list I'd like to share with you some of my
experiences:

1. [Editing with Pandoc](/instructions/Editing-With-Pandoc) - This is a tutorial
   I'm creating where I use VS Code & Pandoc along with an Azure DevOps repo to
   convert a Word Document into Markdown and reversing the process and creating
   other formats, such as a Web Page. I also use Azure DevOps to store the files
   in a GIT repository to show how this may be used to future modifications.

## Conclusion

I do thank you for visiting and if you do have any feedback, please email me at <wralex@gmail.com>

Thanks Again üòÉ‚ùó
