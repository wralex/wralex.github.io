  ## Overview

  As a candidate for this certification, you should have subject matter expertise in integrating, transforming, and
  consolidating data from various structured, unstructured, and streaming data systems into a suitable schema for
  building analytics solutions.

  As an Azure data engineer, you help stakeholders understand the data through exploration, and build and maintain
  secure and compliant data processing pipelines by using different tools and techniques. You use various Azure data
  services and frameworks to store and produce cleansed and enhanced datasets for analysis. This data store can be
  designed with different architecture patterns based on business requirements, including: Modern data warehouse (MDW),
  Big data, Lakehouse architecture
  
  As an Azure data engineer, you also help to ensure that the operationalization of data pipelines and data stores are
  high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a set of business requirements and constraints. You help to
  identify and troubleshoot operational and data quality issues. You also design, implement, monitor, and optimize data
  platforms to meet the data pipelines.

  As a candidate for this certification, you must have solid knowledge of data processing languages, including: SQL,
  Python, Scala
