# Student lab manual

## Lab requirements

- This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps supported browser.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/server/compatibility?view=azure-devops#web-portal-supported-browsers)

- **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

## Lab overview

In the context of Azure DevOps, the term **technical debt** represents suboptimal means of reaching tactical goals, which negatively affects the ability to achieve strategic objectives in software development and deployment. Technical debt affects productivity by making code hard to understand, prone to failures, time-consuming to change, and difficult to validate. Without proper oversight and management, technical debt can accumulate over time and significantly impact the overall quality of the software and the productivity of development teams in the longer term.

[SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/){:target="\_blank"} is a cloud-based code quality and security service. The main features of SonarCloud include:

- Support for 23 programming and scripting languages, including Java, JS, C#, C/C++, Objective-C, TypeScript, Python, ABAP, PLSQL, and T-SQL.
- There are thousands of rules to track down hard-to-find bugs and quality issues based on powerful static code analyzers.
- Cloud-based integrations with popular CI services, including Travis, Azure DevOps, BitBucket, and AppVeyor.
- Deep code analysis for exploring all source files in branches and pull requests, helping reach a green Quality Gate and promote the build.
- Speed and scalability.

In this lab, you'll learn how to integrate Azure DevOps with SonarCloud.

> **Note**: Before you run this lab, ensure that you have the ability to run Azure Pipelines. Due to the change to public projects that took place in February 2021, access to pipelines will need to be requested: <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/change-in-azure-pipelines-grant-for-public-projects/>

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Set up an Azure DevOps project and CI build to integrate with SonarCloud.
- Analyze SonarCloud reports.
- Integrate static analysis into the Azure DevOps pull request process.

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisites for the lab, which consist of a team project based on the [Sonar Scanning Examples repository](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples.git).

#### Task 1: Create the team project

In this task, you will create a new Azure DevOps project based on the [Sonar Scanning Examples repository](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples.git) repository.

    > **Note**: Record the value of the token necessary to set up the SonarCloud Service Endpoint and the value of the **Project Key** and **Project Name**.

### Exercise 1: Set up an Azure Pipeline that integrates with SonarCloud

In this exercise, you will set up an Azure Pipeline that integrates with SonarCloud.

> **Note**: We will set up a new build pipeline that integrates with SonarCloud to analyze the **SonarExamples** code.

#### Task 1: Initiate creation of the project build pipeline

In this task, you will begin creating the build pipeline for our project.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Switch to the web browser window displaying the **SonarExamples** pane in the Azure DevOps portal. Go to **Project settings** and change **Visibility** to private and **Save**.

    > **Note**: This need to be done if you followed the steps in Mod 00 to setup a parallel job for private projects only and your organization currently has no jobs available for public project.

#### Task 2: Create a pipeline by using the YAML editor

In this task, you will create a pipeline by using the YAML editor.

> **Note**: Before you continue with configuration of the YAML pipeline, you will first create a service connection for SonarCloud.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Pipelines** and then click **Create Pipeline**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Where is your code?** pane, click **Azure Repos Git**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Select a repository** pane, click **SonarExamples**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Configure your pipeline** pane, click **.NET Desktop** YAML template.

    > **Note**: This will automatically display the YAML editor with the template YAML file open. In order to configure it correctly you will need to adjust it (or replace it) so that matches the following file:

    ```yaml
    trigger:
    - master

    pool:
      vmImage: 'windows-latest'

    variables:
      buildConfiguration: 'Release'
      buildPlatform: 'any cpu'

    steps:
    - task: NuGetToolInstaller@0
      displayName: 'Use NuGet 4.4.1'
      inputs:
        versionSpec: 4.4.1

    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'NuGet restore'
      inputs:
        restoreSolution: 'SomeConsoleApplication.sln'

    - task: SonarCloudPrepare@1
      displayName: 'Prepare analysis configuration'
      inputs:
        SonarCloud: 'SC'
        organization: 'myorga'
        scannerMode: 'MSBuild'
        projectKey: 'dotnet-framework-on-azdo'
        projectName: 'Sample .NET Framework project with Azure DevOps'


    - task: VSBuild@1
      displayName: 'Build solution **\*.sln'
      inputs:
        solution: 'SomeConsoleApplication.sln'
        platform: '$(BuildPlatform)'

    - task: SonarCloudAnalyze@1
      displayName: 'Run SonarCloud analysis'

    - task: SonarCloudPublish@1
      displayName: 'Publish results on build summary'
    ```

    > **Note**: You can download the file **net-desktop-sonarcloud.yml** from the [SonarSource GitHub repository](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-vsts/blob/master/yaml-pipeline-templates/net-desktop-sonarcloud.yml).

    > **Note**: The YAML pipeline needs to be modified by following the remaining steps in this task.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **NuGetCommand@2** task, replace `restoreSolution: 'SomeConsoleApplication.sln'` with `restoreSolution: '**\SomeConsoleApplication.sln'` to account for the fact that our solution is not located in the root of the repo.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **SonarCloudPrepare@1** task, click **Settings** option to open visual helper, choose the created **sonarSC** service connection from the dropdown and replace the value of the fields as proposed on the **Sonarcloud website > Configure Azure Pipeline** section. Click **Add** to include the changes to pipeline.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **VSBuild@1** task, replace `solution: 'SomeConsoleApplication.sln'` with `solution: '**\SomeConsoleApplication.sln'` to account for the fact that our solution is not located in the root of the repo.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Review your pipeline YAML** pane, click **Save and Run** and, on the **Save and run** pane, click **Save and run**.

    > **Note**: Skip the next task if you completed this task in YAML editor.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Go to Azure Pipelines > Pipelines and click in **Sonarexample** pipeline, wait for the pipeline to finish.

#### Task 3: Check pipeline results

In this task, you will check pipeline results.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the build run pane (either YAML or Classic one created before) , review the content of the **Summary** tab and then click the **Extensions** tab header.

    > **Note**: If you left the **Publish Quality Gate Result** task enabled, the **Extension** tab includes the summary of the SonarCloud analysis report.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Extensions** tab, click the **Detailed SonarCloud report**. This will automatically open a new browser tab displaying the report on your SonarCloud project page.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you could browse to you SonarCloud project.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Verify that the report does not include the Quality Gate results and note the reason for its absence.

    > **Note**: To be able to see the Quality gate result, after running he first report we need to set **New Code Definition**. This way, subsequent pipeline runs will include Quality Gate results.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Overview** tab of the SonarCloud project (Sonarcloud website), click on **Administration** icon (left column) and **New Code**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **New code** tab of the SonarCloud project, click **Previous version**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> Switch to the web browser window displaying the **SonarExamples** project pane in the **Azure DevOps portal** with the most recent build run, click **Run new** and, on the **Run pipeline** pane, click **Run**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the build run pane, review the content of the **Summary** tab and then click the **Extensions** tab header.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Extensions** tab, click the **Detailed SonarCloud report**. This will automatically open a new browser tab displaying the report on your SonarCloud project page.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> Verify that the report and Azure DevOps **extension** tab now **includes the Quality Gate result**.

    > **Note**: We have now created a new organization on SonarCloud and configured an Azure DevOps build to perform analysis and push the results of the build to SonarCloud.

### Exercise 2: Analyze SonarCloud reports

In this exercise, you will analyze SonarCloud reports.

#### Task 1: Analyze SonarCloud reports

In this task, you will analyze SonarCloud reports.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Overview** tab of the SonarCloud project, we see a summary for the report about the **main** branch. If you click **Main branch** icon (left column), and choose **Overall Code**, you will see a more detailed report.

    > **Note**: The page has  metrics such as **Code Smells**, **Coverage**, **Duplications**, and **Size** (lines of code). The following table briefly explains each of these terms.

    | Terms | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Bugs** | An issue that represents an error in code. If this has not broken yet, it will, and probably at the worst possible moment. This needs to be fixed |
    | **Vulnerabilities** | A security-related issue which represents a potential backdoor for attackers |
    | **Code Smells** | A maintainability-related issue in the code. Leaving it as-is means that, at best, maintainers will have a harder time than they should when making subsequent changes. At worst, they'll be so confused by the state of the code that they'll introduce additional errors as they make changes |
    | **Coverage** | An indication of the percentage of code that is being validated by tests such as unit tests. To guard effectively against bugs, these tests should exercise or cover a large portion of your code |
    | **Duplications** | The duplications decoration shows which parts of the source code are duplicated |
    | **Size** | Provides the count of lines of code within the project including the number of statements, functions, classes, files and directories |

    > **Note**: The letter displayed next to the bug count designates the **Reliability Rating**. In particular, the letter **C** indicates that there is at least 1 major bug in this code. For more information on Reliability Rating, refer to [SonarQube documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Metric+Definitions#MetricDefinitions-Reliability). You will also find there more information on [rule types](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/rules/) and see [severities](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/issues/).

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Click the number designating the count of **Bugs**. This will automatically display the content of the **Issues** tab.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the right side of the **Issues** tab, click the large rectangle representing the bug to display the corresponding code.

    > **Note**: Review the error details in line number 9 of **Program.cs** file, including the recommendation stating **Change this condition so that it does not always evaluate to 'true'; some subsequent code is never executed.**

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Hover with the mouse pointer over vertical lines between the code and the line numbers to identify gaps in code coverage.

    > **Note**: Our sample project is very small and has no historical data. However, there are thousands of [public projects on SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects) that have more interesting and realistic results.

### Exercise 3: Implement Azure DevOps pull request integration with SonarCloud

In this exercise, you will set up pull request integration between Azure DevOps and SonarCloud.

> **Note**: In order to configure SonarCloud analysis to perform analysis of code included in an Azure DevOps pull request, you need to perform the following tasks:

- Add an Azure DevOps personal access token to a SonarCloud project, which authorizes its access to pull requests.
- Configure an Azure DevOps branch policy that controls a pull request-triggered build

#### Task 1: Create an Azure DevOps personal access token for pull request integration with SonarCloud

In this task, you will review the personal access token requirements for implementing Azure DevOps pull request integration with a SonarCloud project.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Switch to the web browser window displaying the **SonarExamples** project in the Azure DevOps portal.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> **Reuse** Azure DevOps personal access token you generated earlier in this lab or repeat the steps described earlier in this lab in order to generate a personal access token with the **Code** scope and **Read & write** permissions to the **SonarExamples** project.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can reuse the personal access token you generated earlier in this lab.

    > **Note**: SonarCloud comments to pull requests will be added in the security context of the user who created the personal access token. The recommended practice is to create a separate "bot" Azure DevOps user for this purpose, to clearly identify comments originating from SonarCloud.

#### Task 2: Configure pull request integration in SonarCloud

In this task, you will configure pull request integration in SonarCloud by assigning an Azure DevOps personal access token to your SonarCloud project.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Switch to the web browser window displaying the **SonarExamples** project in the **SonarCloud portal**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the project's dashboard page, click the icon for the **Administration** tab and, in the dropdown menu, click **General Settings**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **General Settings** page, click **Pull Requests**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **General** section of the **Pull Requests** settings, in the **Provider** dropdown list, select **Azure DevOps Services** and click **Save**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **Integration with Azure DevOps Services** section of the **Pull Requests** settings, in the **Personal access token** textbox, paste the previously generated Azure DevOps personal access token and click **Save**

#### Task 3: Configure a branch policy for integration with SonarCloud

In this task, you will configure an Azure DevOps branch policy for integration with SonarCloud.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Switch to the web browser window displaying the **SonarExamples** project in the **Azure DevOps portal**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Repos** and, in the **Repos** section, click **Branches**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Branches** pane, in the list of branches, hover with the mouse pointer over the right edge of the **master** branch entry to reveal the vertical ellipsis character designating the **More options** menu, click it, and, in the popup menu, click **Branch policies**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **master** pane, to the right of the **Build Validation** section, click **+**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Add build policy** pane, in the **Build pipeline** dropdown list, select the pipeline you created earlier in this lab, in the **Display name** textbox, type **SonarCloud analysis** and click **Save**.

    > **Note**: Azure DevOps is now configured to trigger a SonarCloud analysis when any pull request targeting the **master** branch is created.

#### Task 4: Validate pull request integration

In this task, you will validate pull request integration between Azure DevOps and SonarCloud by creating a pull request and reviewing the resulting outcome.

> **Note**: You will make a change to a file in the repository and create a request to trigger SonarCloud analysis.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu bar on the left side, click **Repos**. This will display the **Files** pane.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the central pane, in the folder hierarchy, navigate to the file **Program.cs** in the **sonarqube-scanner-msbuild\\CSharpProject\\SomeConsoleApplication** folder and click **Edit**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Program.cs** pane, add the following empty method to the code directly above the line `public static bool AlwaysReturnsTrue()`

    ```csharp
    public void Unused(){

    }
    ```

1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Program.cs** pane, click **Commit**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Commit** pane, in the **Branch name** textbox, type **branch1**, select the **Create a pull request** checkbox, and click **Commit**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **New pull request** pane, select **Create**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Overview** tab of the **Updated Program.cs** pane, monitor the progress of the build process to its completion.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Overview** tab of the **Updated Program.cs** pane, note that while required checks succeeded, there are optional checks that failed and click the **View 3 checks** link.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Checks** pane, review the results of the SonarCloud checks and close the pane.

    > **Note**: The results show that the analysis builds completed successfully, but that the new code in the PR failed the Code Quality check. Comment has been posted to the PR regarding the new issue that was discovered.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> Back on the **Overview** tab of the **Updated Program.cs** pane, scroll down to the section containing comments and review the comment from SonarCloud regarding the newly added class.

    > **Note**: The reported issues contain only changes in the code corresponding to the pull request. Pre-existing issues in **Program.cs** and other files are ignored.

#### Task 4: Block pull requests in response to failing Code Quality checks

In this task, you will configure blocking of pull requests in response to failing Code Quality checks.

> **Note**: At this point, it is still possible to complete the pull request and commit the corresponding changes even though Code Quality checks fail. You will modify Azure DevOps configuration to block the commit unless the relevant Code Quality checks pass.

1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the Azure DevOps portal, displaying the **Updated Programs.cs** pane, in the lower left corner, click **Project Settings**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> In the **Project Settings** vertical menu, in the **Repos** section, click **Repositories**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **All repositories** pane, click **SonarExamples**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **SonarExamples** pane, click the **Policies** tab header.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the listing of **Policies** scroll down to the listing of branches and click the entry representing the **master** branch.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **master** pane, scroll down to the **Status Checks** section and click **+**.
1. <input type="checkbox" /> On the **Add status policy** pane, in the **Status to check** dropdown list, select the **SonarCloud/quality gate** entry, ensure that the **Policy requirement** option is set to **Required**, and click **Save**

    > **Note**: At this point, users will not be able to merge pull request until the Code Quality check is successful. This, in turn, requires that all issues identified by SonarCloud have been either fixed or marked as **confirmed** or **resolved** in the corresponding SonarCloud project.

## Review

In this lab, you learned how to integrate Azure DevOps Services with SonarCloud.
