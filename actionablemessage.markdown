This page will discuss my development and use of creating an Actionable Message service
with Microsoft 365 SHarePoint and Power Platform tools.

My first project with this was to allow for a team to generate a form based on a Word Document
that would be sent via email where the receiver had to fill in the form manually, scan it,
and then send it back to the requestor all within email. I took the original Word document
and using the very useful site [Adaptive Cards - Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/)
I was able to create the form and test it by sending it to my own email account.

Here is a view of the site:
