Add any files that the learner needs to download in order t complete the exercises.
These may include:
- Code starter files
- Data files
- Scripts to setup a "starting point" for an exercises

If appropriate, organize the files into folders that correspond to the exercises (e.g. 01, 02, etc.)

In the lab instructions, include the steps that the learner needs to follow to get the files into their lab environment. Typically, this is accomplished by:
- Instructing the learner to clone this repo (assumes they have Git installed and are sufficiently skilled to use it).
- Providing hyperlinks to individual RAW files in this repo.

Delete this file after you've added your assets to the repo.
